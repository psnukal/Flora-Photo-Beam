# Flora-Photo-Beam
Automated embedded system that redirects sunlight to nearby plants.
<br/>
There are several plants in your surroudings or your compound which do not recieve enough sunlight due to obstacles present around it which affects its growth. Flora Photo Beam helps the plants to a certain extent in this situation. It has a reflector which rotates and relects the sunlight towards the plant.
<br/>
Sunlight is detected and reflected onto the plant continuously, by rotating the reflector at specific angles.The reflector will rotate in a certain range of angle and depending on the intensity of the sunlight, it will stop rotating at that angle and it will reflect the sunlight towards the plant.
<br/>
Temperature and humidity are checked, for optimal growth of the plant and displays it on the LCD screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Main Components used: <br/>
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) – detects sunlight <br/>
Servo Motor – rotates reflector <br/>
DHT11 sensor – checks temperature and humidity <br/>
Arduino UNO – microcontroller <br/>
